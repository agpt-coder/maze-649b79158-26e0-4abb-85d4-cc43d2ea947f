    Log out the current user, invalidating the session token.

    This function simulates user logout by attempting to fetch a dummy user session using the provided session token,
    and then 'invalidating' it. Since the provided database schema does not include sessions or tokens directly,
    this implementation will not actually modify any database records but will simulate the logout process.

    Args:
        session_token (str): The session token provided by the user at login, used to authenticate the user's session for invalidation.

    Returns:
        LogoutResponse: A simple confirmation response model indicating whether the user's session has been successfully invalidated.

    Example:
        session_token = 'some-valid-session-token'
        logout_response = await logout_user(session_token)
        if logout_response.success:
            print(logout_response.message)  # "Successfully logged out."
        else:
            print("Failed to logout.")  # This scenario should not happen with the current implementation.
